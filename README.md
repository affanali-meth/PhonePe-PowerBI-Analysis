📊 PhonePe End-to-End Data Analysis Dashboard | Power BI Project
👋 Overview

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis workflow where transaction-level data from PhonePe was analyzed and visualized using Microsoft Power BI.
The objective was to design an interactive, multi-page business intelligence dashboard that tracks financial transactions, service performance, and failure patterns — replicating a real-world fintech analytics scenario.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze overall transaction trends across multiple financial services

Identify and visualize reasons behind failed payments

Provide service-level insights (Loans, Insurance, Money Transfers, Recharge & Bills)

Enable interactive exploration of data through slicers and navigation buttons

Apply a brand-aligned design system using PhonePe’s signature theme

🧠 Key Insights Delivered

Total transaction amount exceeded ₹3,333M with 300K+ transactions analyzed

About 12K failed transactions, categorized by reason (e.g., server error, wrong PIN, insufficient balance)

Loans recorded the highest transaction volume (~₹102M) among all services

Transaction trends showed peak performance in March and July, each crossing ₹16M

A clear visual distinction between successful and failed payments aids decision-making
